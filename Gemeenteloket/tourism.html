          <div class="watertoren"> <h2>Watertoren</h2> <p>The Water Tower found in Zoetermeer has been designed by the architect C. Visser. Construction started in 1927 and construction was finished in 1928. A foundation called ‘Stichting Drinkwaterleiding De Tien Gemeenten’ requested the construction.
The water tower is 48,65 meters tall and the water reservoir is 500 m³ in total. The square around the Water Tower has been decorated with multiple stones, containing the names of the members of the foundation. Those being Wassenaar, Stompwijk, Zoetermeer, Zegwaart, Benthuizen, Moercapelle, Zevenhuizen, Bleiswijk, Bergschenhoek, Berkel, Pynacker, Nootdorp and Veur. All coats of arms can be seen around the entrance, except the ones from Stompwijk and Veur. Next to that, the build year and the province’s coat of arms can be seen as well.
The miniature town in The Hague called Madurodam contains a scaled model of the water tower.

          <div class="Nelson"> <h2>Nelson Mandelabrug</h2> <p>The Nelson Mandela Bridge is a bridge for walkers and cyclists, designed by Johan Bak. The bridge was opened in 1992 and has a length of 180 meters. The bridge connects the Boerhaavelaan in the Driemanspolder district with the Plein van de Verenigde Naties in the Rokkeveen district and crosses the national highway called A12 and two railways, one for the local RandStadRail and the other for the national trains. The bridge passes through the building called the 'Poort van Zoetermeer'. The bridge was built to connect the new district Rokkeveen with the rest of Zoetermeer and the Floriade in 1992. The old bridge built in 1973 was too small for the expected number of visitors.
The architect used the blue-yellow colours of Zoetermeer's coat of arms in the bridge’s design. The blue steel structure combined with yellow windows. The bike path and footpath are separated by an artpiece designed by Arnold Hamelberg. There are three escalators and a lift on both sides of the stairs.
In addition to a bridge for walkers and cyclists, the bridge also functions as a station hall for RandstadRail station Driemanspolder and train station Zoetermeer of the NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen).

The Dobbe has been used as a water supply when Zoetermeer was just a village. Nowadays the Dobbe lies directly next to the Stadshart, Zoetermeer’s city centre. On the north side of the Dobbe is a large parking lot which is used as a market place on market days and there are special events on a regular basis. Next to this parking space lies the town hall and the city centre, which has more than two hundred shops and catering establishments. There is also a catering facility directly next to the water.
